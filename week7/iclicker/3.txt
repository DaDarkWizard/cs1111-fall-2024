What happens if you try to access an element outside the bounds of an array?

a) The program will terminate with an error.

b) The compiler will generate a warning.

c) It will access a random memory location, leading to unpredictable behavior.

d) It will "wrap around" and access an element from the beginning of the array.


Correct answer= none of these - the program might terminate, might generate
a warning, but will have unpredictable behavior.
It does not wrap around.
